 Write a C program "cat.c" which takes a text file name as input
and prints the contents of the file in the stdout/ console. The filename
must be provided as a command-line argument (e.g. cat ABC.txt). Handle
errors/exceptions generated during the execution of the program.

CODE:

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
int main( int argc, char* argv[] )
{
  FILE *fp;
  char c;
  fp=fopen(argv[1],"r");
  if(fp == NULL)
  {
   printf("File doesn't exit");
   exit(0);
}
c=fgetc(fp);
while(c!= EOF )
{
 printf("%c" ,c);
 c=fgetc(fp);
}
fclose(fp);
return 0;
}
